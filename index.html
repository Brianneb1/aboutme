                Brianne Bender

                I am a sophomore working on a BS degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Information Security. I
                am planning on graduating at the end of the Fall 2020 semester.

                <h2>Plans</h2>

                I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with my life. I enjoy coding obviously, so I think software
                engineering, database management, or game development would be fun areas to go into. My emphasis in
                security will help me with pretty much any field.

                <h2>Background</h2>

                I'm from Gladstone, Missouri which is a suburb of Kansas City. I went to Oak Park High School and
                participated in pretty much all the bands and choirs there. As for prior experience, I worked as a
                Quality Assurance Intern for American Century Investments this past summer. I've also accepted an
                internship for this coming summer as a Software Engineer Intern at Principal Financial Group.
