Brianne Bender

I am a sophomore working on a BS degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Information Security. I am planning on graduating at the end of the Fall 2020 semester.

I'm from Gladstone, Missouri which is a suburb of Kansas City. I went to Oak Park High School and participated in pretty much all the bands and choirs there. As for prior experience, I worked as a Quality Assurance Intern for American Century Investments this past summer. I've also accepted an internship for this coming summer as a Software Engineer intern at Principal Financial Group. 

I'm not sure exactly what I want to do with my life. I enjoy coding obviously, so I think software engineering, database management, or game development would be fun areas to go into. My emphasis in security will help me with pretty much any field.

Something interesting about me is I play clarinet for the Northwest Wind Symphony.
